React and Redux Test1
=====================

The following directory holds my second attempt in implementing react.js and redux store code.
Everything in this directory is written by hand, rather then generated using ``npm init``.

Main usage are with ``Babel``, ``Webpack``, ``React`` and ``Redux``.

The aim of the appliation is writing from scratch with no infulence of other code a simple todo list application.

It is not a production ready, but more of learning tool from a tutorial to code.
